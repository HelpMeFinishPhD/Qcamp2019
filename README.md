# Qcamp 2019
(Forked from Qcamp 2018 repo)

## QKD implementation, with a twist.

This repo consists of programs, missions, and handouts for Qcamp 2019 experimental session.
http://qcamp.quantumlah.org/

One can read more about this project at [arxiv link] (soon, I promise).

In short, this session consists of gamified do-it-yourself experiments, designed to convey the ideas and steps of a Quantum Key Distribution implementation and also include a remark about potential security issues. Note also that this is not a QKD implementation, even though they share a lot of properties and similarities.

For more information, you can email the organisers (mathias.seidler@u.nus.edu, jianwei.leejw@gmail.com, or anuutama@gmail.com). You can also email the current year organisers @[CH's email].
