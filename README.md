# Qcamp 2019
Slightly modified from Qcamp2018 repo. 

## QKD implementation, with a twist.

This repo consists of programs, missions, and handouts for Qcamp 2019 experimental session.
http://qcamp.quantumlah.org/

One can read more about this project at https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02565 or https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/10.0001895
The current caretaker of the project is S-fifteen instruments (https://s-fifteen.com/blogs/news/supporting-educators). They are developing a commercial product, building on top of the programs/worksheets presented here. For any enquiries, contact them at info@s-fifteen.com. 

In short, this session consists of gamified do-it-yourself experiments, designed to convey the ideas and steps of a Quantum Key Distribution implementation and also include a remark about potential security issues. Note also that this is not a QKD implementation, even though they share a lot of properties and similarities.
