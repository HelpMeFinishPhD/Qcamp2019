# Qcamp 2019
Slightly modified from Qcamp2018 repo.

## QKD implementation, with a twist.

This repo consists of programs, missions, and handouts for Qcamp 2019 experimental session.
http://qcamp.quantumlah.org/

One can read more about this project at [arxiv link] (soon, I promise).

In short, this session consists of gamified do-it-yourself experiments, designed to convey the ideas and steps of a Quantum Key Distribution implementation and also include a remark about potential security issues. Note also that this is not a QKD implementation, even though they share a lot of properties and similarities.
